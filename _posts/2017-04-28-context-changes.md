I.

When people want to "find themselves", they often go far away. Sometimes they take drugs. Sometimes they take up some new hobby. They usually engage in some sort of context change. Rarely do they decide to hang out with the same people and in the same place as normal while acting slightly differently.

This seems smart. If you are represented as some kind of machine dashboard with a bunch of dials (shyness: 7, appreciation for violent sports: 2, amount of time needed to unwind: 8), they may be set to values that are adaptive to your current environment but not others. Trying out new environments is a good way to find out how rusty the dials are: can you become much less shy if the other people around you aren't so loud, or if you have to be less shy to make friends? Being in a new environment means some of your adaptive dials should end up somewhat different places, which is valuable information.

Not all environments are the same. The ones that have the most chance of moving your dials to new places are probably furthest from your current environment on some metric of environmental alikeness, so these will have high informational content. Which features should be most emphasized in this similarity metric?

People are probably the most important, as is emphasized time and again. Most of people's self-image isn't in how they interact with the stones and trees, but in how they interact with people. They play a complicated game with those around them, filling niches to gain favor, being warped by social pressure to avoid losing favor, and thinking and talking like their neighbors to better communicate and argue for their own viewpoints and ends.

Self-seekers going far away don't journey across the U.S.&mdashthey go to Europe, or to Thailand, or to Africa. These are chosen not because of some inherent climatic change or geographic uniqueness, but because of the people. Being in a group of very different people with different cultures is the fastest way to start questioning your assumptions, rotating your dials to fit in, or even becoming proud of your own customs and dial-settings. 

An important corollary to this is that even one person who was in your social circle before switching environments can have a profound influence on how you change. A lot of how people view their own dials is built around how other people view their dials (it's important to be on the same page as your tribemates), so if you go on a road trip with your friend you will probably find your dials far less malleable as you keep up the narrative from your past life. If you were to suddenly do something that someone with shyness:7 wouldn't normally do, and that person is surprised, that is easily enough inconvenience to stop your monkey brain from experimenting.

Of course, other factors also influence your dial malleability. While you don't normally think of yourself in relation to the walls of your house like you think of yourself in relation to your best friend, your neural nets feel comfortable in your house, because they tell your monkey brain that you know this territory. When you're in other places you've been before, your brain doesn't assume it may have to change to fit in. But in novel places, it starts opening up. 

II.

CFAR workshops work strangely well compared to what one might expect from 40 hours of classes in cognitive techniques. A CFAR workshop spread over a semester of school seems like it would have gains from spaced repetition but lose a lot more, from something else.

Most of this unexpected effectiveness is probably from the context change making people more open to experience. It is especially powerful because it's a new group of people, so participants get a chance to fully recompute their local Overton window. No one has preconceived notions about the workshop, many of the participants have more extreme dial settings than most of the population, and participants are explicitly encouraged to push at the boundaries of their dials and try things. All of this contributes to the group having a generally very wide Overton window, and a whole lot of dial-spinning getting experimented with.

I expect that people who attend CFAR with people they know get slightly less out of it, people who know the instructors get less than that, and if workshops were to be run on groups of e.g. Google employees they would get even less (though still a lot). To have the worst workshop possible, you could also host it in the employees' office.

Unfortunately, it is known that a lot of CFARers lose their newly accessed states of consciousness within a few weeks after the workshop. I expect people who go straight back to their old life to have this the worst&mdashthey immediately begin to conform to their friend circle's old view of them, unlike what occurs when you have ample time away and you can plausibly come back a "different person". Further, they are immediately back in the comfortingly known places they used to be, so their neural nets stop remarking on the benefits to be had from openness. Even if new alums just rented an AirBnB for a week after the workshop, I expect much greater gains to be had.
