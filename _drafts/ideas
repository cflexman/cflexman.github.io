Why physics basic research won't affect the future as much any more (fusion, space travel, and nanotech are all potential applied physics / engineering places this is wrong though)

Math as a community vs rationalists as a community. This is like the one space that people who want to be known for ideas can actually find that outside of research places like math! Real meritocracy for intellectuals, instantiated.

Meeting my first socialite, it's crazy how all the opinions are tailored to be costly to replicate. Which makes me wonder: is there something about the opinions/decisions we focus on that make them suited for this? It turns out that for most nodes that have actual payoff, we do the payoff thing and don't think much about them after that. So only superfluous things are left to be modulated for status, and that's why it's so annoying!

Maybe unshared environment is largely chaotic systems like what ideas you're exposed to and when and how high of social status you have at that time and stuff
