We say that people always follow incentives, but this means that people like an estranged wife that have little left to gain from you will frequently turn, and in a nasty way once a lot of money is on the line.

People aren't correctly calibrated to amount of defection: selfish ONA should be much nicer, but we're calibrated to EEA where we could get away with a lot more (now there is more paper trail, etc)
