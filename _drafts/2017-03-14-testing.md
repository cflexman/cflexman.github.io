Upon a given stimulus, many people think the obvious thoughts and stop. Some of the obvious thoughts are wrong. If some of these people wanted to do better, how should they go about this? 

First, you have to train
SSC
LW

Second, you have to want to think more things
many times during standard operations you want to not overthink
But things that are kind of complicated or contain knowledge about how the world works, you want to think more about

Some of it is just noise

Does protectionism hurt other states?
simulate
examples
Should I come at this a different way?
What do I expect the world to look like if true? if false?
Are there similar situations where we act subtly differently, or the same? (should all CFAR staff do ops to be full-stack; well, should they do legal things?)
