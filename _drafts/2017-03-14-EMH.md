People are endlessly debating the EMH and it's so annoying
There is also an EMH for ideas, but not phrased as efficiently
SSC's post on scientific consensus is an example
Obviously, EMH is more true in some circumstances and less true in others
Look at the limits: with a bunch of dumb people, their ideas will converge slowly; with many smart ones, quickly
Most markets that are liquid follow EMH; hard to short things, hard to invest in crypto
Most markets that are transparent follow EMH; mortgage bonds and CDOs were untransparent, so much less liquid
Most markets with proper incentives follow EMH; mortgage bonds and CDOs were the opposite, and academic fields e.g. psychology don't necessarily follow this (replications unincentivized, publish or perish incentivizes p-hacking, hard to move correct ideas through because you must convince others WITH COMMON KNOWLEDGE [new paragraph on how ideas move])
Any time you have ideas that others don't, the market is lagging and you are about to make it efficient
Part of this is informational lag, because info is hard to propagate for several reasons: among which are poor compression styles -> sheer mass, poor compression styles -> difficult assimilation, poor completeness (people leave out most of the relevant examples, stats, and world-models, dropping only a few at a time) on the part of the writers, and heuristical thinking and failure to follow up on low-credence hypotheses with further research on the part of the reader (which is an adaptive trait when taken in each example, but leaves low-hanging fruit for society).
Cryptocurrencies seem to have some kind of poor info flow going on in which people in the know buy them at first, but soon other people find out and also buy. Don't know why they keep IPOing low, but maybe some altcoins have gone high and then failed? Not sure. 
Old market failures: systematically underpricing tail risk (transparency? info?), systematically overpricing standard volatility (liquidity), systematically failing to update quick enough upon mergers (info), 

What about the current Ponzi scheme thing?
