Why is it high-status to quote things from the past or reference agreed-upon ideas of the future, but low-status to present new ideas?
Lots of reasons.
If I say we should work on making it higher-status, I also need to acknowledge the current incentives are actual incentives, and subtly change what's going on in people's minds. This requires not a plea to value something different, but some sort of work that really hammers home the new prioritization: fiction perhaps, or poetic, exhortative nonfiction showing a different dynamic than you're used to, highlighting all the examples that your mind needs to back up the new node.
