Prison reform: rape protection incentives

A lot of times the little guy gets screwed. But there is usually some way to extract value from them if you take their side, aligning incentives. For example, prisons where you pay the prisoners slightly less but provide increased security against rape seems plausible. [how do prisons decide how much to pay? Can prisoners choose prisons?]

Other scenarios?
