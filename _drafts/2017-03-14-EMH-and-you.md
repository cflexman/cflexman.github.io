EMH in finance: things move down the inefficiency spectrum with their bad qualities
You have to walk down the bad qualities gradient, not shy away
Same is true in startup-land: ex Stripe, AirBnb, Lisp in Viaweb, SpaceX, 
Same is true in nature: new species find new niches
Same is true of 
Same thing is true in our lives!
Ex: physics degree, porn, trash collector, saving money (median person is broke), 
You have to *actually* make sacrifices to get ahead of where your natural talent would get you
(if you have the natural talent for doing glamorous things, go for it)
Soylent, shit housing/living where you work, no TV, no news, not going out to eat, reading more, reducing friend time / relationships, etc.
Most of these are specifically things that are costly socially—we expect this because social signals tend to be the ones that aren't costly in other, real ways. But humans are so into social signals. This is one reason that so many really successful people tend to be bad at social stuff—they're succeeding despite being socially awkward, not because of it as some people think. 
Anyways, you have to find the ones of these that are easiest to do without. Play to your comparative advantage: that's the only way to beat EMH.
