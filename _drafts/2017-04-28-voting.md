Response about value of voting:

Critch said very positive
Ben Hoffman made some corrections but also questioned main statistic
All statistics are proxies for some complex objective function, so I think his argument is unfair
That being said, there are better targets available
Using this sheet, one can look at different effects parties might have
Then take into account whether they'll be able to pass anything on them
Get slight order-of-magnitude diff
Can go further and convert into QALYs, but this is difficult



othing to see here, [nothing at all][conspiracy]. Can you even see `this`?
