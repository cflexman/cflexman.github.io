It's historically been difficult to reason about other universes, because by definition you can't interact with them. By logical positivism's standards, you're missing empiricism, so the only thing you have to resort to is theory. And people like to ascribe limits to our ability to theorize in other universes, saying things like "whatever you can reason about in this universe is on a brain in this universe, so who knows what you can't even comprehend that may hold under other scientific laws" or the like. It's true that if we can only reason about things we see in our universe, then the door is closed on otherworldly speculation. But does this condition hold?

First, the historical evidence. Through history, a lot of people have said "you can never know X because of these theoretical limits". This argument was applied to the paths of heavenly bodies, the complexity of biology, and the workings of the brain. Many more people said things like "you can't do X". This is very weak evidence, but should be enough to promote the hypothesis of "are we wrong this time?" to consideration.

Second, more historical evidence. String theory (or M-theory) claims to reduce the number of likely universes to 10^500. This claim rests on universes being run on physical law related to ours---but surely the counterclaim would be that this is just from the math in our universe, and we couldn't comprehend the other possibilities.

So the question is: how much can we comprehend?

We can comprehend about other mathematical universes pretty well. First, we abstracted out simple constants: what would it be like if gravity were slightly stronger (the gravitational constant were larger)? Then, we started abstracting out dimensions of space, considering what 4-D or higher-dimensional worlds would be like. Then we started abstracting out which forces are possible in quantum field theory and what symmetries are possible and more. Finally, we started abstracting out what math was and how that even works. There is some confusion about whether everything is based on math or computation, but this is a really deep question and the point is that we're pretty close to figuring out how abstract things can even interact.

If we get deep enough into math and computation, we are basically looking at all possible physical laws in universes. And so you might question whether "physical law" has to govern all universes, and whether we might be failing to comprehend universes where physical law doesn't hold. But you start to get into a situation where you can't describe the interaction of two different things without saying that there is some outcome, and if there is some outcome you can describe it with math. At base, math is about describing all the relations between all the things. So for any kind of universe with any objects in it at all, you can definitely describe how it works by using math.

I'm actually relatively confident about this. It's possible that I can't comprehend non-math universes because I'm stuck in a math universe, but seriously, it doesn't make sense. What does it mean for there to be a universe---some collection of things in existence---without you being able to describe what the things do? It doesn't really make sense, even when I try super hard to think outside the box. And there are all sorts of sassy responses to this, like the fact that of course not being able to comprehend something that is incomprehensible by definition isn't somehow evidence against the thing existing, butâ€”--even after doing a lot of math on things that definitely don't exist and talking to people about things that don't exist and thinking about things that don't exist while in altered states of consciousness, I'm still actually pretty sure that all universes will contain things that exist and be describable by math.

To say "this even seems formalizable" is silly, because opponents would certainly retort that you can only formalize it with math and this begs the question. But problems in philosophy have over and over again been explained away by good math and science, to the point where they no longer feel like questions worth considering, and I do actually hope that even this most unanswerable of questions will soon be properly explained away---that it won't feel natural to ask "what about things that math can't talk about?"

If we grant that math exists in all universes, we can soon talk about all universes with math---and probably the same math, at that.
Then we can start looking at what other universes should be like, given what we know of math.
We can think about whether all computable universes exist, and perhaps what measure
We can think about how often Boltzmann brains arise in all universes
We can think about all the branches of the wavefunction in our universe, and whether different levels of physical law ever change in our universe
We are probably simulated, in which case we can consider what the simulators' universe is like
We can also talk about what game theory is like in the simulators' universe (the same)
We can talk about whether, even if we are simulated, the fact that the simulators' universe exists still implies that all computable universes exist
We can talk about which universe is most likely to be simulating us, and how many other simulations they could probably run (hint, lots)
We can talk about what values evolution is likely to cause to prevail in those universes, and why we are being simulated
We can talk about what implications these have on how to keep our sim running (or whether we need to, given measure considerations); are they potentially running us as the UNSONG god, creating all positive universes? By which values might they be measuring good?







othing to see here, [nothing at all][conspiracy]. Can you even see `this`?
