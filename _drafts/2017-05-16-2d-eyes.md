There's an old Richard Feynman quote about how he was watching the surface of a swimming pool while people were diving in and started thinking about how a clever insect in the corner could reconstruct everything that had happened just from how the surface moved up and down, similar to how we use light waves. My question is: how different would the insect's algorithm have to be from our eyes' algorithms?
